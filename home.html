      What one may find, lost and left, all will know. Demands of a home leave artifacts alone, dust collects, rust, erect still among wooded fills in the land, between now and soon on demand, roads don't stand the weight of travel from one to another, visible from other places far off, soft they see through tree and me elsewhere world away i see yet again the despare when cease be there a light hung tight now cracked in spite of the wilted flowers, they share a space on the bed shrown and unsaid of the man whom head the table. Below candlelight he sits, striped of name, dead spits blame, old wine lined straight, vine up stair to bear the view, distant stew waves due to consume memories all will know.

      <div class="box"><p> Empty houses full of old life trinkets, exist between timelines of human enjoyment and loss. When we look at how often humans have the same experiences or emotions in our lifetime as others do today--whether they are emotional reactions to something that happens decades ago, a stressful experience on New Year's Day 2007, an event whose consequences make us feel terrible when it comes around again two months later, or some other long-term consequence such so called "reversal"—we see those who died before being born had much less chance of experiencing this state than their own children does now. The difference is huge for everyone: your child dies tomorrow morning; yours will soon become disabled if he never makes new friends enough after graduating college.</p></div>
