    <p>Hello World!</p> <!--include intro for normal people then detail box for the old people-->
    You have found yourself on the start page of my website.
    <p>My project is based around liminal spaces, invetigating what elements make a space liminal and places where this can be found. The beta website is exploring how far i can create a 90's style webpage reminiscient of early blogs and social medias though the turn of the last century.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore every page and element of the website, each page will eventually have content, and many photos are clickable so you can view them in great detail.</p>
